# Social Recommendations & Insights - Sprint 11-12 Implementation

## üìã Overview

This document describes the implementation of AI-powered Social Recommendations and Insights for the Diet Game application, completed in Sprint 11-12. The system provides intelligent recommendations for friends, teams, content, and mentorship, along with comprehensive social analytics and insights.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### AI Recommendation Engine
The social recommendation system uses a sophisticated AI engine that analyzes multiple factors to provide personalized recommendations:

- **Friend Matching**: Mutual connections, common interests, location, activity level, and goals
- **Team Formation**: Goal alignment, activity compatibility, location proximity, and team availability
- **Content Curation**: Interest relevance, friend connections, engagement patterns, and recency
- **Mentorship Pairing**: Goal alignment, experience level matching, availability, and ratings

### Database Schema
The recommendation system extends the existing social features with:

- **Recommendation Feedback**: User feedback on recommendations for ML improvement
- **Performance Tracking**: Analytics on recommendation effectiveness
- **Insights Cache**: Cached social insights for performance optimization
- **Algorithm Versioning**: Track different recommendation algorithm versions
- **User Preferences**: Personalized recommendation settings
- **Interaction Tracking**: Detailed analytics on user interactions

### Service Layer
- **SocialRecommendationService**: Core AI recommendation logic
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing social and gamification systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and efficient database queries
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic recommendation refresh capabilities
