Analyze the technical architecture in more detail

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll analyze the technical architecture of the Diet Game project in detail. Let me start by gathering relevant context and then examining the architecture documentation.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    • Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    • When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    • Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: technical architecture diet game system design components

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
