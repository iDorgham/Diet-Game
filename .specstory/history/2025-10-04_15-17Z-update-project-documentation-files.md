_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you update the homepage documentation files. Let me first retrieve any relevant knowledge about this project and then analyze the current state of the documentation to provide comprehensive updates.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    • Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    • When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    • Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: homepage design implementation tasks requirements diet game

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

+ ## Implementation Details
+ 
+ ### Technology Stack
+ - **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
+ - **State Management**: Zustand store (`nutriStore.ts`)
+ - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom oceanic theme
+ - **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
+ - **Animations**: Custom AnimatedProgressBar component
+ - **Real-time Updates**: Zustand store with reactive updates
+ 
+ ### Data Flow Architecture
+ ```typescript
+ // Store Integration
+ const progress = useProgress();           // User progress data
+ const userProfile = useUserProfile();    // User profile information
+ const headerStatus = useHeaderStatus();  // Time and status data
+ const { completeTask } = useNutriStore(); // Task completion actions
+ 
+ // Real-time Updates
+ - Progress updates trigger re-renders automatically
+ - Task completion updates store state immediately
+ - News ticker rotates every 4 seconds
+ - XP progress bars animate on data changes
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Performance Optimizations
+ - **Memoization**: Expensive calculations memoized with `useMemo`
+ - **Component Splitting**: Separate components for each metric card
+ - **Lazy Loading**: Ready for future lazy loading implementation
+ - **Efficient Re-renders**: Zustand store minimizes unnecessary updates
