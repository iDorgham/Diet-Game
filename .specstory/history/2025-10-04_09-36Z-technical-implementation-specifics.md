## Architecture Overview
The Diet Planner Game follows a **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** approach with a modern React-based frontend architecture:

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom oceanic palette (#085492 primary, #71E6DE mint)
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence + React Query for server state
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore) with real-time sync
- **Build**: Vite with production optimizations
- **Deployment**: Docker + Nginx with multi-stage builds

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Component Architecture (Atomic Design)
```
App
├── Header (Navigation + User Status)
├── Main (Page Components)
│   ├── HomePage (Dashboard + Metrics)
│   ├── TasksPage (Kanban Board)
│   ├── CoachPage (AI Chat)
│   └── Other Pages
└── Footer (Legal + Language)
```

#### 2. State Management Strategy
- **Local State**: React hooks for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- **Server State**: React Query with caching and real-time updates
- **Real-time Sync**: Firestore listeners with offline queue

#### 3. Data Flow Architecture
```
User Action → Component → Zustand Store → Firestore → Real-time Update
```

### Key Implementation Files

#### State Management (`src/store/nutriStore.ts`)
```typescript
// Zustand store with persistence and real-time sync
export const useNutriStore = create<NutriState>()(
  subscribeWithSelector(
    persist(
      immer((set, get) => ({
        // User data, app state, UI state
        // Actions: updateProgress, completeTask, etc.
        // Computed values: getXPProgress, getStars, etc.
      })),
      { name: 'nutriquest-storage', storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage) }
    )
  )
);
```

#### Firebase Integration (`src/services/firebase.ts`)
```typescript
// Firebase services with retry logic and error handling
export class FirestoreService {
  static async updateUserProgress(userId: string, updates: Partial<UserProgress>, retries: number = 3)
  static subscribeToUserProgress(userId: string, callback: (progress: UserProgress) => void)
}
```

#### API Service (`src/services/api.ts`)
```typescript
// Advanced API service with React Query integration
export class NutriQuestAPI {
  static async completeTask(userId: string, request: TaskCompletionRequest): Promise<TaskCompletionResponse>
  // Includes retry logic, batch operations, error handling
}
```

#### XP System (`src/utils/xp-system.ts`)
```typescript
// Gamification system with XP rewards and leveling
export const XP_REWARDS = { MEAL: 15, SHOPPING: 20, COOKING: 30, EXERCISE: 40 };
export const calculateXPForNextLevel = (level: number): number => level * 100;
export const checkAndApplyLevelUp = (currentProgress, xpGained, setMessage) => { /* level up logic */ };
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Code Splitting
- Lazy loading of page components
- Dynamic imports for heavy dependencies
- Route-based code splitting

#### 2. State Optimization
- Memoized selectors with Zustand
- React.memo for expensive components
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect

#### 3. Caching Strategy
- React Query for API responses (5-10 minute stale times)
- Local storage for user preferences
- Service worker for offline capabilities

### Security Architecture

#### 1. Authentication
- Anonymous Firebase authentication
- Secure token management
- Session persistence

#### 2. Data Security
- Firestore security rules
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without data exposure

### Deployment Architecture

#### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
# Build stage with security updates
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine AS production
# Production stage with non-root user
```

#### Nginx Configuration
- Custom nginx.conf with security headers
- Gzip compression
- Static file serving
- Health check endpoints

### Development Workflow

#### SDD Process
1. Write specifications in `docs/specs/`
2. Generate components using Cursor Composer
3. Implement business logic
4. Test and validate against specs

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for critical flows
- E2E tests for user journeys

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Gamification System
- XP rewards based on task type and difficulty
- Level progression with bonus coins
- Star milestone system
- Streak multipliers (3x, 7x, 14x, 30x days)

#### 2. Real-time Updates
- Firestore listeners for live data sync
- Offline queue for pending updates
- Optimistic updates for responsive UI

#### 3. Advanced State Management
- Zustand with Immer for immutable updates
- React Query for server state caching
- Persistence with localStorage
- Computed selectors for derived state

#### 4. Error Handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error boundaries for component isolation
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
- Comprehensive error logging

### Scalability Considerations

#### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Load balancer ready
- Container orchestration support

#### 2. Database Scaling
- Firestore automatic scaling
- Efficient query patterns
- Data partitioning strategies

#### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Web Vitals tracking
- Custom performance metrics
- Real-time user analytics
- Sentry integration for error tracking

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a production-ready gamified diet planning application with real-time features, offline support, and scalable infrastructure.
