_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you create comprehensive steering documents for your Diet Game project. Let me first explore the project structure and existing documentation to understand the current state and requirements.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game project steering documents product vision technical architecture

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: README.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: package.json

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/README.md

---

Now let me explore the existing architecture and specifications to understand the project better:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/architecture/system-architecture.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/diet-game-overview.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/architecture/high-level-diagram.mmd

---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined â€¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Now let me check if there are any existing steering documents and examine the current project structure more closely:


---

Tool use: **glob_file_search**

<details>
<summary>Searched codebase "*steering*" â€¢ **1** result in **1** directory</summary>

Directory: **d:\Work\AI\Projects\Diet Game** (1 file)

| File |
|------|
| `steering documents` |

</details>

---

Tool use: **glob_file_search**

<details>
<summary>Searched codebase "product.md" â€¢ **0** result in **1** directory</summary>

Directory: **d:\Work\AI\Projects\Diet Game** (0 file)

</details>

---

Tool use: **glob_file_search**

<details>
<summary>Searched codebase "tech.md" â€¢ **0** result in **1** directory</summary>

Directory: **d:\Work\AI\Projects\Diet Game** (0 file)

</details>

---

Tool use: **glob_file_search**

<details>
<summary>Searched codebase "structure.md" â€¢ **0** result in **1** directory</summary>

Directory: **d:\Work\AI\Projects\Diet Game** (0 file)

</details>

---

Perfect! I can see that there are no existing steering documents (product.md, tech.md, structure.md), so I need to create them from scratch. Let me also examine some key implementation files to understand the current state better:


---

Could not find file 'src/App.tsx' in the workspace.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: vite.config.js

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: tailwind.config.js

---

Let me check the main App component:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/AppWithPages.tsx

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/AppIntegrated.tsx

---

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project. Let me create the three steering documents based on the project analysis:


---

Tool use: **write**

Now let me store this knowledge about the steering documents creation process:


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-store-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    â€¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    â€¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    â€¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Created comprehensive steering documents for Diet Game project:

**product.md**: Complete product vision including target users (health-conscious millennials, fitness enthusiasts, busy professionals), key features (gamified nutrition tracking, AI coaching, social community), business objectives with short/medium/long-term goals, competitive advantages (AI personalization, gamification excellence, scientific foundation), success metrics, and product roadmap.

**tech.md**: Detailed technical architecture covering React 18 + TypeScript frontend, Vite build system, Tailwind CSS, Zustand state management, React Query for server state, Firebase backend services, AI integration with Grok API, comprehensive testing with Vitest, and Spec-Driven Development (SDD) principles. Includes performance optimization, security architecture, scalability considerations, and future technical roadmap.

**structure.md**: Complete codebase organization showing modular architecture with clear separation of concerns - components organized by feature (ui/, gamification/, forms/, layout/), pages for main application screens, custom hooks for reusable logic, services layer for API integration, state management with Zustand, comprehensive documentation structure in docs/, and clear file naming conventions.

All documents follow the project's oceanic theme (#085492 primary, #71E6DE secondary) and align with the existing comprehensive documentation in docs/ folder. The steering documents provide strategic direction for the AI-powered gamified nutrition application.
