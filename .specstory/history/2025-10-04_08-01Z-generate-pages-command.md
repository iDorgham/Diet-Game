_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you generate pages for your Diet Game project. Let me first understand the current project structure and then create the necessary pages based on your specifications.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    • Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    • When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    • Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game project pages structure and requirements

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
</details>

Let me examine the current project structure and specifications to understand what pages need to be generated.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/homepage/requirements.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/ai-coach-system/requirements.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/gamification-engine/requirements.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/HomePage.tsx

---

Now let me examine the existing project structure to understand what additional pages need to be generated:


---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/nutrition-tracking/requirements.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/social-community/requirements.md

---

Now let me check the existing components and store structure to understand the current implementation:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/store/nutriStore.ts

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/types/index.ts

---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Now I'll generate the comprehensive pages for the Diet Game project based on the specifications. Let me create the main pages that are needed:


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-store-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    • Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    • Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    • Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Diet Game project structure analysis:

**Current Pages:**
- HomePage.tsx (existing) - Dashboard with metrics, tasks, shopping list

**Required Pages based on specs:**
1. NutritionTrackingPage - Food logging, barcode scanning, nutritional analysis
2. AICoachPage - Personalized recommendations, food analysis, motivational messages  
3. GamificationPage - XP system, achievements, leaderboards, virtual economy
4. SocialCommunityPage - User profiles, friends, team challenges, social feed
5. ProfilePage - User settings, preferences, account management
6. SettingsPage - App configuration, notifications, privacy

**Key Components:**
- Zustand store with persistence and real-time sync
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Oceanic color palette (#085492, #71E6DE)
- Firebase integration for real-time updates
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
