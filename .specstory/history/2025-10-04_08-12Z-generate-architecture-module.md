_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see you're referencing the system architecture document I just generated. The `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of the Diet Planner Game's system architecture. Let me highlight the key aspects of this document:

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

The document covers the complete architectural foundation of the Diet Planner Game, structured around **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** principles:

### **Core Architecture Principles**
1. **SDD Approach**: All components generated from specifications in `docs/specs/`
2. **Component-Based**: React frontend with modular, reusable components
3. **State Management**: Multi-layered approach (Local → Global → Persistent)

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand + React Query + React Hook Form
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- **Tools**: Vitest, ESLint, Docker, Nginx

### **System Layers**
```
Frontend Layer (React App)
├── Pages (Home, Tasks, Coach, Nutrition, Gamification)
├── Components (UI, Forms, Animations)
├── Hooks (Custom, React Query)
└── Services (API, Firebase, Utils)

Backend Services (Firebase)
├── Authentication (Anonymous Auth)
├── Firestore (User Data & Progress)
└── Real-time Listeners

External Integrations
├── Grok AI API (AI Coach)
├── Recipe APIs (Nutrition Data)
└── Market APIs (Shopping Data)
```

### **Key Features**
- **Real-time synchronization** with Firestore
- **Performance optimization** with code splitting and caching
- **Security architecture** with Firebase Auth and data protection
- **Scalable deployment** with Docker and Kubernetes
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with error tracking and performance metrics

### **Data Flow Patterns**
1. **Authentication**: User → App → Firebase Auth → Firestore → User Data
2. **Task Completion**: User Action → Component → State Manager → Firestore → Real-time Update
3. **AI Coach**: User Message → Coach Component → AI API → Response → Firestore → UI Update

The architecture is designed to be:
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling with stateless design
- **Secure**: Multi-layer security with Firebase integration
- **Performant**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and SDD approach

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the system architecture, or would you like to explore how this relates to the other architecture documents I generated?
