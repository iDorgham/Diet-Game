_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you create comprehensive content for all the app pages in the Diet Game project. Let me first examine the existing page documentation and then create detailed content for each page.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    • Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    • When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    • Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game app pages content structure and requirements

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Let me check the content directory to see what's already there:
