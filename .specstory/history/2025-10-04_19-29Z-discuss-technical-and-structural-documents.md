          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    â€¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    â€¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    â€¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference
