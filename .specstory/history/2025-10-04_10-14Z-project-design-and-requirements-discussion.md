_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll analyze the homepage design, requirements, and tasks documentation to understand the current state and provide insights.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    ‚Ä¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    ‚Ä¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    ‚Ä¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    ‚Ä¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: homepage implementation progress diet game React components

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Let me examine the current homepage implementation to understand what's already been built:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/HomePage.tsx

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/App.jsx

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/AppWithPages.tsx

---

Let me try a different approach and check the project structure:


---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Now let me read the existing HomePage implementation:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/pages/HomePage.tsx

---

Now let me check the store implementation to understand the data structure:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/store/nutriStore.ts

---

Now let me check the types to understand the data structure:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/types/index.ts

---

Now let me store this knowledge and provide a comprehensive analysis:

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    ‚Ä¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    ‚Ä¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    ‚Ä¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    ‚Ä¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Homepage Implementation Analysis:
