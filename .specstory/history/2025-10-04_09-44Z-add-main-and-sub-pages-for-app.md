10 Main Pages (Core Hubs)
These are the primary screens, accessible via the bottom tab navigation (e.g., Home, Coach, etc.). Each has descriptions, wireframes, and code stubs in docs/pages/.

Homepage - Dashboard with daily quests, metrics grid (e.g., XP, calories), news ticker, tasks list, and shopping overview.
Coach Page - AI Coach chat interface for personalized plans (e.g., "Post-HIIT carb swap") using Grok API.
Tasks Page - Kanban board for quests and tasks, with drag-and-drop and realtime updates.
Nutrition Page - Hub for meal logging, nutrient tracking, and personalized diet insights.
Workouts Page - Fitness routines, tracking, and integration with wearables like Apple Health.
Finance Page - Budget tracker for meal/shopping expenses, tailored to local currencies (e.g., LE in Egypt).
Rewards Page - Redeem XP/elixirs for badges, unlocks, and premium features.

10 Avatar Drop-Menu Sub-Pages (Account & Settings)
These are secondary screens linked from the avatar dropdown in the header (sections: Account, Diet, Health). They handle user-specific settings and are detailed in docs/ui-components/avatar-drop-menu.md and docs/specs/feature-specs/menu/.

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you add more pages to the Diet Game application. Let me first retrieve any existing knowledge about the current page structure and then create the additional pages you've specified.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    • Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    • Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    • When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    • Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game pages structure current implementation

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
