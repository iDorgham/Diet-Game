_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll analyze the current gamification system documentation and suggest additional features that would enhance the Diet Game's engagement and user experience.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: gamification features diet game nutrition tracking engagement

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

## ðŸ“Š **Additional Documentation Files to Create**

```
docs/gamification/
â”œâ”€â”€ skill-trees.md
â”œâ”€â”€ challenge-system.md
