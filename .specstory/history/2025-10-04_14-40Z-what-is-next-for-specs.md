what is next @specs/

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll analyze the current state of the specs directory to understand what's been completed and what needs to be done next.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    ‚Ä¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    ‚Ä¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    ‚Ä¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    ‚Ä¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game project specs implementation status and next steps

Let me examine the specs directory structure and the current implementation status to determine what's next.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/specs/README.md

---

Now let me check the organization plan to see the current status:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md

---

Let me also check the organization complete status:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: docs/ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md

---

Now let me check what specific specs are missing or incomplete by examining the current structure:


---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Based on my analysis of the specs directory, here's what's next for the Diet Game project specifications:

## üéØ Next Steps for @specs/

### üìä Current Status Analysis

**‚úÖ Complete Specifications (4/4 files):**
- `ai-coach-system/` - All files present
- `api-endpoints/` - All files present  
- `database-schema/` - All files present
- `gamification-engine/` - All files present
- `homepage/` - All files present
- `social-community/` - All files present
- `deployment-infrastructure/` - All files present

**‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete Specifications (missing tasks.md):**
- `nutrition-tracking/` - Missing `tasks.md`

**üîß Partial Specifications (missing requirements.md and tasks.md):**
- `api-architecture/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `caching-architecture/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `calendar-component/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `component-template/` - Missing `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`
- `dashboard-page/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `event-driven-architecture/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `leaderboard-system/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `monitoring-architecture/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `onboarding-page/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `reward-system/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`
- `wizard-component/` - Missing `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`

### üöÄ Priority Order for Completion

#### **Phase 1: Critical Missing Files (High Priority)**
1. **`nutrition-tracking/tasks.md`** - Complete the only missing file from a mostly complete spec
2. **`api-architecture/requirements.md`** - Core infrastructure needs requirements
3. **`api-architecture/tasks.md`** - Core infrastructure needs implementation plan

#### **Phase 2: Core Component Specifications (Medium Priority)**
4. **`dashboard-page/requirements.md`** - Main user interface needs requirements
5. **`dashboard-page/tasks.md`** - Main user interface needs implementation plan
6. **`onboarding-page/requirements.md`** - User onboarding needs requirements
7. **`onboarding-page/tasks.md`** - User onboarding needs implementation plan

#### **Phase 3: Architecture Specifications (Medium Priority)**
8. **`caching-architecture/requirements.md`** - Performance optimization needs requirements
9. **`caching-architecture/tasks.md`** - Performance optimization needs implementation plan
10. **`event-driven-architecture/requirements.md`** - System architecture needs requirements
11. **`event-driven-architecture/tasks.md`** - System architecture needs implementation plan
12. **`monitoring-architecture/requirements.md`** - System monitoring needs requirements
13. **`monitoring-architecture/tasks.md`** - System monitoring needs implementation plan

#### **Phase 4: Component Specifications (Lower Priority)**
14. **`calendar-component/requirements.md`** - UI component needs requirements
15. **`calendar-component/tasks.md`** - UI component needs implementation plan
16. **`wizard-component/requirements.md`** - UI component needs requirements
17. **`wizard-component/tasks.md`** - UI component needs implementation plan
18. **`component-template/requirements.md`** - Template system needs requirements
19. **`component-template/design.md`** - Template system needs design
20. **`component-template/tasks.md`** - Template system needs implementation plan

#### **Phase 5: Feature Specifications (Lower Priority)**
21. **`leaderboard-system/requirements.md`** - Gamification feature needs requirements
22. **`leaderboard-system/tasks.md`** - Gamification feature needs implementation plan
23. **`reward-system/requirements.md`** - Gamification feature needs requirements
24. **`reward-system/tasks.md`** - Gamification feature needs implementation plan

### üéØ Immediate Next Action

**Start with `nutrition-tracking/tasks.md`** since it's the only missing file from an otherwise complete specification. This will bring the nutrition tracking system to 100% completion.

Would you like me to create the missing `nutrition-tracking/tasks.md` file to complete that specification?

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-store-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    ‚Ä¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    ‚Ä¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    ‚Ä¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    ‚Ä¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Diet Game specs directory analysis shows 11 incomplete specifications missing requirements.md and/or tasks.md files. Priority order: 1) Complete nutrition-tracking/tasks.md (only missing file from complete spec), 2) Add missing files to api-architecture, 3) Complete core components like dashboard-page and onboarding-page, 4) Finish architecture specs, 5) Complete UI components and gamification features. Total of 24 missing files across 11 specifications.
