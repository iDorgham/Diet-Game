@FILES_TO_CREATE.md MEDIUM Priority Contracts , LOW Priority Contracts, and after update the file

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you create the missing MEDIUM and LOW priority contracts from the FILES_TO_CREATE.md file. Let me first retrieve any relevant knowledge about the project structure and then create the missing contract files.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: contracts architecture patterns data models API integration

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    â€¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    â€¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    â€¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Successfully created all MEDIUM and LOW priority contracts for the Diet Game project:

**MEDIUM Priority Contracts Created:**
1. `websocket-contracts.md` - WebSocket message contracts for real-time communication
2. `external-api-contracts.md` - External API integration contracts (USDA, Edamam, Spoonacular, etc.)
3. `message-contracts.md` - Message queue contracts for asynchronous communication
4. `hook-contracts.md` - Custom React hook interface contracts
5. `service-contracts.md` - Service layer interface contracts

**LOW Priority Contracts Created:**
1. `microservice-contracts.md` - Internal microservice contracts with service discovery
2. `utility-contracts.md` - Utility function contracts for validation, formatting, calculations

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all contract types
- Error handling patterns and validation schemas
- Service-to-service communication protocols
- Real-time WebSocket event contracts
- External API integration specifications
- Custom hook interfaces with proper typing
- Service layer abstractions
- Microservice architecture contracts
- Utility function specifications

**Updated Progress:**
- Contracts completion: 15/15 files (100%) âœ…
- Overall project completion: ~80% ðŸš€
- All HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priority contracts now complete

The contracts follow consistent patterns with proper TypeScript typing, error handling, validation, and documentation standards established in the existing HIGH priority contracts.

2. **`utility-contracts.md`** - Utility function contracts for validation, formatting, calculations, and helper functions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features Implemented**

- **Comprehensive TypeScript Interfaces** - All contracts include detailed type definitions
- **Error Handling Patterns** - Consistent error handling and validation schemas
