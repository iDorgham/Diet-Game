# Update priority templates in file (2025-10-04 15:36Z)

_**User (2025-10-04 12:58Z)**_

@FILES_TO_CREATE.md  MEDIUM Priority Templates , LOW Priority Templates and after update the file 

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you create the MEDIUM and LOW priority templates from the FILES_TO_CREATE.md file and then update the file to mark them as completed. Let me start by retrieving any relevant knowledge about the project structure and templates.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: template structure and patterns for Diet Game project documentation

*Result*:

Let me examine the existing templates to understand the structure and patterns used in this project.

Now I'll create the MEDIUM and LOW priority templates. Let me start with the MEDIUM priority templates:

It looks like the progress was already updated. Let me store the knowledge about the templates I created:

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-store-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions.
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
    â€¢ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
    â€¢ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
    â€¢ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand for future reference

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Created comprehensive template system for Diet Game project with 10 new templates:

**MEDIUM Priority Templates Created:**
1. `graphql-template.md` - Complete GraphQL schema, resolver, and service templates with TypeScript interfaces, validation, testing, and best practices
2. `webhook-template.md` - Webhook handler template with authentication, payload validation, error handling, retry logic, and security considerations
3. `spec-template.md` - Technical specification template with requirements, architecture, API specs, data models, security, performance, testing, and implementation plans
4. `architecture-template.md` - Architecture documentation template with system context, container diagrams, deployment architecture, security, performance, and scalability considerations
5. `integration-test-template.md` - Integration test template using Vitest and Supertest with API testing, database integration, caching, external services, and performance tests
6. `e2e-test-template.md` - End-to-end test template using Playwright with page object model, accessibility tests, responsive design, performance, security, and cross-browser testing

**LOW Priority Templates Created:**
7. `api-doc-template.md` - Comprehensive API documentation template with authentication, rate limiting, error handling, endpoints, data models, examples in multiple languages, and SDKs
8. `config-template.md` - Configuration file template with Zod validation, environment variable mapping, utilities, watchers, and Docker/Kubernetes configurations
9. `env-template.md` - Environment variables template with development, staging, and production configurations, validation, and setup scripts
10. `docker-template.md` - Docker configuration template with multi-stage builds, Docker Compose, Nginx configuration, monitoring services, and deployment scripts

All templates follow consistent structure with placeholders, comprehensive examples, best practices, testing approaches, and related documentation. Updated FILES_TO_CREATE.md to mark all templates as completed (15/15 files, 100%).

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.
