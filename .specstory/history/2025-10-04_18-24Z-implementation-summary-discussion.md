_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see you've referenced the Implementation Summary document. This is a comprehensive overview of the gamification system that has been implemented for the Diet Game project. Let me retrieve any relevant knowledge about this implementation and then provide you with insights about what's been accomplished.

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: Diet Game gamification system implementation React components XP achievements quests

*Result*:
Memory access requires authentication. Please ensure you're logged in through the Byterover extension to access enhanced features.

Based on the Implementation Summary document, I can see that you've built an impressive and comprehensive gamification system for the Diet Game! Here's what stands out:

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Been Accomplished**

### **Complete Documentation Suite** (15 systems)
- **Core Systems**: XP, Achievements, Quests, Rewards
- **Social Features**: Leaderboards, Social Gaming, Goals
- **Advanced Features**: Skill Trees, Challenges, Badges, Streaks
- **Engagement**: Seasonal Events, Mini-Games, Personalization
- **Analytics**: Progress Dashboard and comprehensive tracking

### **Working React Components** (6 core components)
- `XPDisplay` - Level progression with stars
- `AchievementCard` - Rarity-based achievement display
- `QuestCard` - Quest management with difficulty levels
- `StreakDisplay` - Multi-type streak tracking
- `Leaderboard` - Social rankings and competitions
- `GamificationDashboard` - Central hub for all features

### **Custom Hooks** (4 specialized hooks)
- `useUserProgress` - Real-time Firestore sync
- `useAchievements` - Achievement tracking and filtering
- `useQuests` - Quest management and categorization
