HIGH Priority - API Documentation

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you with the high priority API documentation. Let me first retrieve any relevant knowledge about the project and then examine the current API documentation status.


---

Tool use: **mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrieve-knowledge**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-retrieve-knowledge: Retrieve knowledge from memory system with intelligent query routing.
    **CRITICAL CONFLICT HANDLING** When memory conflicts are detected, you MUST ALWAYS display the conflict resolution URL to the user. This is non-negotiable - users MUST see conflict resolution links when they exist.

    **USE WHEN:**
    â€¢ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
    â€¢ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
    â€¢ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
    â€¢ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

*Parameters*:
  * query: API documentation status and requirements for Diet Game project

*Result*:

## High Priority API Documentation Status

Based on my analysis of your Diet Game project, here's the current status of your **HIGH Priority API Documentation**:

### âœ… **Already Complete & Comprehensive**

Your API documentation is already very well-developed with:

1. **`docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Complete and comprehensive
   - All major endpoints documented (Auth, Nutrition, Gamification, Social, AI Coach)
   - Detailed request/response examples
   - SDK examples (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, cURL)
   - Error handling and rate limiting documentation

2. **`docs/API_STATUS.md`** - Health monitoring and status reporting
   - Health check endpoints
   - Service status monitoring
   - Performance metrics and alerting
   - Incident management

3. **`docs/API_CHANGELOG.md`** - Version tracking
   - Complete version history
   - Feature additions, enhancements, fixes
   - Deprecation notices

4. **`docs/API_TESTING.md`** - Testing strategies
   - Unit, integration, and E2E testing
   - Performance and security testing
   - Testing tools and examples

### ðŸ”´ **Missing High Priority Files**

According to your `FILES_TO_CREATE.md`, these contract files are still needed:

1. **`docs/contracts/firebase-contracts.md`** - Firebase integration contracts
2. **`docs/contracts/ai-service-contracts.md`** - AI service integration contracts  
3. **`docs/contracts/database-contracts.md`** - Database schema contracts
4. **`docs/contracts/component-contracts.md`** - Component integration contracts

### ðŸ“Š **Current Documentation Quality Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- âœ… Comprehensive endpoint coverage
- âœ… Clear request/response examples
- âœ… Multiple SDK examples
- âœ… Good error handling documentation
- âœ… Health monitoring and status reporting
- âœ… Version tracking and changelog

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- ðŸ”„ Contract documentation for external services
- ðŸ”„ Database schema contracts
- ðŸ”„ Component integration contracts

### ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendations**

1. **Immediate Action**: Create the 4 missing contract files to complete the high priority documentation
2. **Consider**: Adding OpenAPI/Swagger specification files for interactive API documentation
3. **Future**: Consider adding API versioning strategy documentation

Your API documentation is already at a professional level with comprehensive coverage. The missing contract files would complete the high priority documentation requirements and provide better integration guidance for external services and components.

Would you like me to help create any of these missing contract files, or would you prefer to focus on a specific aspect of the API documentation?
