# Deployment Infrastructure

## üìã Overview

The Deployment Infrastructure specification defines the complete infrastructure setup for the Diet Game application, including cloud architecture, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, security, and scalability solutions to ensure reliable, secure, and performant application delivery.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Architecture

The deployment infrastructure consists of several key components:

- **Cloud Platform**: Multi-cloud deployment strategy with primary and backup regions
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes-based container management
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive observability and alerting
- **Security**: Multi-layered security with encryption and access controls
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling and load balancing for high availability
