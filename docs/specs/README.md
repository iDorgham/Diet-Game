# Diet Game Specifications - Complete Guide

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains comprehensive specifications for the Diet Game application, organized into a structured folder-based format for each major component. This guide explains the new structure, how to use it effectively, and best practices for maintaining and updating specifications.

## 🚨 Current Status: Reorganization in Progress

**IMPORTANT**: We are currently reorganizing the specifications to eliminate duplication and improve maintainability. The current structure has both main files (e.g., `ai-coach-system.md`) and folders (e.g., `ai-coach-system/`) with overlapping content.

**New Structure**: We are moving to a **folder-first approach** where each specification is contained in its own folder with a README.md for navigation.

## 🏗️ Target Directory Structure

Each specification will be organized into a dedicated subdirectory containing essential files:

## 🆘 Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Questions and Answers

#### Q: Which file should I update for a new feature request?
**A**: Start with `requirements.md` to define what needs to be built, then update `design.md` if technical changes are needed, and finally update `tasks.md` with implementation details.

#### Q: How do I handle changes that affect multiple specifications?
**A**: Update the primary specification first, then review and update all dependent specifications. Use the dependency diagram to identify affected components.

#### Q: What if requirements and design conflict?
**A**: Requirements take precedence. Update the design to meet the requirements, or clarify the requirements if the design reveals issues.

#### Q: How detailed should tasks be?
**A**: Tasks should be detailed enough for a developer to implement without additional clarification, typically 1-3 days of work each.

#### Q: When should I create a new specification vs. updating an existing one?
**A**: Create a new specification for a major new component. Update existing specifications for enhancements or modifications to current components.
