# Master Specifications

## üìã Overview

The Master Specifications folder contains consolidated documentation that aggregates requirements, design specifications, and implementation tasks from all individual system components in the Diet Game project.

## üìÅ Structure

This folder contains three master documents that consolidate information from all system specifications:

| File | Purpose | Source Folders |
|------|---------|----------------|
| [`master-requirements.md`](./master-requirements.md) | Consolidated requirements from all system components | All `requirements.md` files |
| [`master-design.md`](./master-design.md) | Consolidated design specifications from all system components | All `design.md` files |
| [`master-tasks.md`](./master-tasks.md) | Consolidated implementation tasks from all system components | All `tasks.md` files |

## üéØ Purpose

These master documents provide:

- **Unified View**: Single source of truth for all project requirements, designs, and tasks
- **Cross-System Analysis**: Ability to identify dependencies and conflicts across systems
- **Project Planning**: Comprehensive view for project management and resource allocation
- **Documentation**: Complete project specification in consolidated format

## üîó Source Systems

The master documents consolidate data from the following system specifications:

### Core Systems
- **AI Coach System**: Intelligent nutrition coaching and recommendations
- **API Architecture**: RESTful API design and GraphQL integration
- **API Endpoints**: Comprehensive API endpoint specifications
- **Database Schema**: Data models and database design
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event handling and messaging patterns

### Infrastructure Systems
- **Caching Architecture**: Performance optimization and caching strategies
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Production deployment and scaling
- **Monitoring Architecture**: System monitoring and observability

### User Interface Systems
- **Homepage**: Landing page and user onboarding
- **Dashboard Page**: Main user interface and navigation
- **Onboarding Page**: User registration and setup flow
- **Calendar Component**: Date and time management interface
- **Wizard Component**: Multi-step form and process components

### Feature Systems
- **Gamification Engine**: XP, achievements, and engagement systems
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Food logging and nutrition analysis
- **Social Community**: User interactions and social features
- **Leaderboard System**: Rankings and competitive features
- **Reward System**: Virtual economy and incentives

### Component Systems
- **Component Template**: Reusable UI component patterns

## üìä Usage Guidelines

### For Project Managers
- Use `master-requirements.md` for scope definition and stakeholder alignment
- Use `master-tasks.md` for resource planning and timeline estimation
- Cross-reference with individual system specifications for detailed implementation

### For Architects
- Use `master-design.md` for system integration and architecture decisions
- Review individual design documents for detailed technical specifications
- Identify cross-system dependencies and integration points

### For Development Teams
- Use `master-tasks.md` for sprint planning and task assignment
- Reference individual task documents for detailed implementation steps
- Use `master-requirements.md` for acceptance criteria and testing

### For QA Engineers
- Use `master-requirements.md` for test case development
- Reference individual requirements for detailed testing scenarios
- Use `master-tasks.md` for test planning and execution

## üîÑ Maintenance

These master documents should be updated when:

- New system specifications are added
- Existing specifications are modified
- Cross-system dependencies change
- Project scope or requirements evolve

## üìû Support

For questions about the master specifications:
- **Requirements Questions**: Review individual system `requirements.md` files
- **Design Questions**: Consult individual system `design.md` files  
- **Task Questions**: Check individual system `tasks.md` files
- **Integration Questions**: Coordinate with relevant system architects
