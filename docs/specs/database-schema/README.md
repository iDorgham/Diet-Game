# Database Schema

## 📋 Overview

The Database Schema specification defines the complete data model for the Diet Game application, including user management, nutrition tracking, gamification, social features, and AI coach integration.

## 🏗️ Database Architecture

The database follows a relational design with the following key characteristics:

- **Database Engine**: PostgreSQL with JSONB support for flexible data
- **Schema Design**: Normalized structure with proper relationships
- **Data Types**: Optimized for performance and scalability
- **Indexing Strategy**: Strategic indexes for query optimization
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled schema changes

## 📁 Documentation Structure

This folder contains the complete database specification:

| File | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md) | Database requirements, constraints, data rules | Product Managers, Database Architects, QA Engineers |
| [`design.md`](./design.md) | Table schemas, relationships, indexes, migrations | Database Developers, Backend Developers, DevOps Engineers |
| [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) | Implementation phases, migration tasks, testing | Development Teams, Database Administrators, QA Engineers |
