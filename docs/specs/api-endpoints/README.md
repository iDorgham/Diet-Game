# API Endpoints

## üìã Overview

The API Endpoints specification defines the RESTful API architecture for the Diet Game application, providing comprehensive endpoints for user management, nutrition tracking, gamification, social features, and AI coach integration.

## üèóÔ∏è API Architecture

The API follows RESTful principles with the following key characteristics:

- **Base URL**: `https://api.dietgame.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Response Format**: Standardized JSON responses with consistent error handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per endpoint type
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning with backward compatibility
