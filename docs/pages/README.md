## Page Integration

### Navigation Structure
All pages are integrated through the main navigation system:

```typescript
// Main navigation items
const navigationItems = [
  { id: 'home', label: 'Home', path: '/', component: HomePage },
  { id: 'nutrition', label: 'Nutrition', path: '/nutrition', component: NutritionTrackingPage },
  { id: 'ai-coach', label: 'AI Coach', path: '/ai-coach', component: AICoachPage },
  { id: 'gamification', label: 'Gamification', path: '/gamification', component: GamificationPage },
  { id: 'community', label: 'Community', path: '/community', component: SocialCommunityPage },
  { id: 'profile', label: 'Profile', path: '/profile', component: ProfilePage }
];
```

### State Management
All pages share common state through the Zustand store:

```typescript
// Shared state across all pages
interface AppState {
  user: UserProfile;
  progress: ProgressData;
  tasks: Task[];
  nutrition: NutritionData;
  gamification: GamificationData;
  social: SocialData;
}
```

### Common Features
All pages include:
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Real-time data synchronization with Firebase
- Offline support and data persistence
- Accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Performance optimization and lazy loading
- Error handling and loading states
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Pages
1. Create page component in `src/pages/`
2. Add to navigation in `MainNavigation.tsx`
3. Add route in `AppWithPages.tsx`
4. Update store types if needed
5. Add page documentation to this file

### Modifying Existing Pages
1. Edit the specific page component
2. Update mock data as needed
3. Test changes thoroughly
4. Update documentation
5. Ensure responsive design works

### Page Testing
Each page should have:
- Unit tests for component logic
- Integration tests for data flow
- Accessibility tests for WCAG compliance
- Visual tests for responsive design
- Performance tests for loading times

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
Pages are lazy-loaded to improve initial bundle size:

```typescript
const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/HomePage'));
const NutritionPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/NutritionTrackingPage'));
```

### Data Loading
- Implement skeleton loading states
- Use React Query for server state management
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement optimistic updates

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree-shake unused code
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size with each change

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Responsive design patterns
- Mobile-specific interactions
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- AR recipe visualization
- Voice-controlled navigation
- Advanced personalization
- Multi-language support
- Advanced social features

### Performance Improvements
- Service worker implementation
- Advanced caching strategies
