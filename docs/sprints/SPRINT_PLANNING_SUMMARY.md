## üìä Sprint Planning Framework

### Planning Process
1. **Pre-Sprint Planning** (1 week before)
   - Review retrospective and project status
   - Estimate team capacity and dependencies
   - Prepare sprint backlog

2. **Sprint Planning Meeting** (4 hours)
   - Define sprint goal and objectives
   - Estimate stories and assign tasks
   - Identify risks and dependencies

3. **Sprint Execution** (2 weeks)
   - Daily standups and progress tracking
   - Continuous integration and testing
   - Risk monitoring and mitigation

4. **Sprint Review & Retrospective** (3 hours)
   - Demonstrate completed features
   - Collect stakeholder feedback
   - Plan next sprint priorities

### Success Metrics
- **Velocity**: 25-30 story points per sprint
- **Quality**: >90% test coverage, <5 critical bugs
- **Performance**: <200ms API response time
- **Team Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: >4.0/5 rating

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Templates

### Project Management
